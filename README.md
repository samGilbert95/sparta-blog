### Description
---
This project tasked me with developing a webpage using rails Active Resources and validations. This task also tested my knowledge of active record relations
### Tech used
---
##### Languages
Ruby and Rails were used for the structure, Bootstrap was used for styling

### Challenges
---
My knowledge of SCSS is lacking, and as such found myself using it mostly in the same way as css, save for occasional style nesting. I also failed to check the datatype I was applying validations to, which broke the system in its entierety.

### Takeaways
---
I found that I need more work on SCSS in order to understand its applications. As well as this, I need to pay more attention to what im doing with validations, in particular checking the data types im applying to.
